            Creative Placemaking

          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-500">
           Sing for Hope’s Creative Placemaking program leverages the power of the arts to drive social cohesion, public health, and wellbeing. For example, our Quality of Commute program reaches thousands of people a day at partner sites including Union Station, Port Authority Bus Terminal, Oculus World Trade Center, Newark Liberty International Airport, and Moynihan Train Hall, delivering top-tier live arts experiences in highly trafficked public spaces. Building upon Sing for Hope’s pandemic-era role as one of the country’s leading employers of freelance musicians, the program shifts the landscape for artist employment through our innovative public-private funding model and reframes the commuting experience in urban centers.

            Creative Crisis Response


          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-500">
           Sing for Hope’s Creative Crisis Response program uses the creative arts to heal, soothe, and inspire individuals affected by crises. For example, our Creative Hope for Refugees program was launched in 2018 at Skaramagas Camp in Athens, Greece, in partnership with El Sistema Greece, and funded by a six-figure grant by an anonymous European foundation. The program is grounded in the belief, championed by the International Rescue Committee, that refugees (and, in particular, refugee youth) are aided in their readjustment and recovery process through access to creative arts and expressive play. Through the program, SFH is providing a safe space, literally and metaphorically, to nurture refugee youth’s social-emotional development through the arts. Creative arts programming has been proven to counter the effects of prolonged stress and suffering. We at SFH are honored to continue to expand our creative programming that addresses migration integration, a key crisis of our era.
